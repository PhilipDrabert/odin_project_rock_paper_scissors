# Rock, Paper, Scissors
## About
This is an educational project based on an exercise from The Odin Project. The goal is to build a rock, paper, scissors game. 
## Process
### Logic
In the first I build the underlying logic of the game with Javascript only using comnsole.log() and prompt() output and input methods.
### User Interface
The second step will consist of adding a user interface.
